# WAKE WORD DETECTION
## Workflow for the Project
1) Preparing Data
2) Preprocessing Data
3) Training Data
4) Prediction and Evaluation

## Future Ideas.
 1) Build a speaker id detection model.
 2) Use the built speaker id detection model paralley with the Wake Word Detection Model to get an output
    such as "Hi {Name of the Detected Speaker} How can I help you." in a robotic voice using some small voice engine.
